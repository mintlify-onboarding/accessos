title: "Blueprints â€” Declarative Configuration"
sidebarTitle: "Overview"
description: "Blueprints are a mechanism to declare your access policy in code for clearer legibility, change management, and auditability. The Blueprint standard is designed to be implemented as a set of easy-to-read configuration files that live in a repository with change management. The Blueprint endpoints are intended to be used in a CI/CD environment to verify and apply Blueprints to AccessOS."

Currently, two types of Blueprints are supported:

<Card title="System Blueprints" icon="map" icontype="duotone" href="/system-blueprint-reference">
   Declare Birthright Access policies, Access Request Workflows, Automatic Access Request Approval rules, resource visibility filters, and custom roles on a per-system basis.
</Card>
<Card title="Access Bundle Blueprints" icon="file-zipper" icontype="duotone" href="/access-bundle-blueprints">
  Declare sets of entitlements that may span multiple systems and which are requestable as single units.
</Card>

## Typical Blueprint Development Flow

1. Peruse the `Examples` in the [System Blueprints reference](/system-blueprint-reference) or the [Access Bundles Blueprints reference](/access-bundle-blueprints) to understand the general structure of a Blueprint.
2. Author a draft Blueprint (in JSON or YAML format) using the relevant reference.
    1. You may find the [JSON schema](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jangerhofer/58246c4c847d4c7e54b9feb8d2340d40/raw/4f1e5b4c765d4652a2d44727cc94972074c37936/schema.json) which describes the shape of a valid Blueprint useful, as many IDEs (e.g. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/json#_json-schemas-and-settings)) will provide autocomplete functionality when editing a JSON file which is tagged with a JSON schema.
    2. Almost all Blueprints will reference a variety of AccessOS entities like Groups, Resources, Roles, etc. [by name or ID](https://www.notion.so/Public-API-Documentation-e381aec183b74671b5940bc8bc2d4b96?pvs=21).  These identifiers can generally be found in:
        1.  the AccessOS web app single system page (`/systems/[sys-id]`); in particular, the `Inventory` tab contains many of the relevant identifiers.
        2. or, less conveniently, in the relevant AccessOS API endpoint.
3. Submit your draft Blueprint to [the `/verify` API endpoint](https://www.notion.so/Public-API-Documentation-e381aec183b74671b5940bc8bc2d4b96?pvs=21) to validate your Blueprint.  This endpoint does not make any configuration changes.  Instead, it merely checks that your Blueprint is syntactically correct and that AccessOS recognizes all references in the Blueprint.
4. Correct any validation errors which are returned in the body of the response from Step (4) alongside a `4xx` status code.  A valid Blueprint, on the other hand, will yield a `200` status code and a body containing the Blueprint which was validated.
5. Finally, to apply the configuration changes in your Blueprint to AccessOS, submit the Blueprint to the [
Apply a Blueprint](/api-reference/blueprints/apply-a-blueprint)  endpoint.  A `200` response indicates that the configuration change has been successfully applied!

## Miscellanea

- All Blueprint endpoints expect a `POST` body in JSON format (i.e. with a `Content-Type: application/json` header)
- Blueprint entity references (e.g. systems, groups, roles, resources, etc.) may generally be specified by either a `name` or an `id` property.
    - The `name` specifier is usually the 'friendly' name for a given entity.  It should match the `name` value returned for a given entity by the AccessOS API endpoint for the entity's kind
        - (e.g. system `name` from [List Systems](https://www.notion.so/List-Systems-47fdc86952e949bfb593b3f7b59b23e3?pvs=21), role `name` from [List Roles](https://www.notion.so/List-Roles-df33f5b2e507467abdfce7dc5fe2ef7b?pvs=21), etc.) or the display name present in the AccessOS UI.
    - The `id` specifier is AccessOS' internal identifier for a given entity.  It matches the `id` field returned by the relevant AccessOS API endpoint.
        - The value is a prefixed UUIDv4; for instance, a system `id` might read: `sys-4a388852-6211-413b-88d8-27093528a893`
    - In the case that multiple entities (within the Blueprint's system) match a given `name`,  the Blueprints endpoints expect the entity to be identified via its `id` to resolve the reference ambiguity.  In this scenario, the endpoints will return an error message similar to:  `Multiple [entities] found for name: [name]. Please provide an ID instead to specify a single [entity].`
