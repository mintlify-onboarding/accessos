# Overview

A System Blueprint configures five facets of system access:

1. **Birthright Access:** Default mappings from Persona/Group to entitlements to cover the bulk of your access management needs and automate the Joiner/Mover/Leaver flow. 
2. **Access Request Workflows:** A flexible IFTTT-style way to describe access requests conditioned on the request parameters, with the desired approval workflows as a result to provide more certain workflows around sensitive resources. 
3. **Automatic Access Request Approvals:** Automatically approve access requests for certain personas for a maximum duration of time. Consider using this for providing prod-access to on-call engineers, or financial access to auditors and supporters. Eliminating long-standing access while reducing friction. 
4. **Request Filters:** Customize the items that employees at your enterprise can request based on their attributes, reducing the risk of wrong requests and providing a more seamless UI for employees 
5. **Custom Roles:** Define your permission sets side-by-side with your access management policy, providing a single source of truth for what folks have access to.

## Examples

_n.b. The below are presented in YAML format for concision, however the Blueprints endpoints expect the Blueprint contained in the request body to be in JSON format._


### Set a default Access Request Workflow approver for Snowflake

```YAML
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://gist.githubusercontent.com/jangerhofer/58246c4c847d4c7e54b9feb8d2340d40/raw/4f1e5b4c765d4652a2d44727cc94972074c37936/schema.json

            kind: com.snowflake#table
        - action:

          resource:
            name: '"ACCESSOS_DEMO"."DEMO"."CUSTOMER"'
            kind: com.snowflake#table

### Declare birthright roles for members of an Okta group 

```yaml

## Fields

In addition to the Blueprints Common Fields, a System Blueprint includes:

<ParamField path="kind" type="string" Required>
  system
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="version" type="integer" Required>
  Monotonically increasing counter tracking the version of the configuration applied to the target of the Blueprint (i.e. the version of system configuration).  Designed to avoid inadvertent overwrites when multiple writers apply differing Blueprints to the same system.
</ParamField>
